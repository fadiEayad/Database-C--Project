# Database-C-Plus-Plus-Project
This is a program that I did in college where it reads a file with inputs and a file with commands and prints out to an output file whatever the command file asks as long as the command is one of the specific commands that this program supports. 
The supported commands are case sensitive. The command file only contains commands sort (sort id, 
sort DOB, sort first name, sort last name, sort years worked, sort position), add at end, add at
beginning, add after (index here), add before (index here), delete (id), delete (index) to (index),
delete at beginning, delete at end, output original. Each line ends in '\n'. Notice that each line 
only contains one command.
